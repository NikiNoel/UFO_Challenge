# UFO_Challenge

To create a web page with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript that will be able to filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria

Background:
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
