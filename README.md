# UFO Challenge

## Purpose
To create a web page with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript that will be able to filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria

## Background
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
When a viewer scrolls below the article, they will have the ability to search based on date, city, state, country, or shape of UFO sighting. A search can be completed with one or multiple filters at  time.

## Summary
* One drawback of this website is the ablity to update with new UFO sightings 

* The website could be updated with a discussion board for fans to comment on post or share their own stories

* The website could clean up the data to give the table a more uniform look (capitalizing locations, make the comments consistent and easy to read)

* Could consider changing the format of date to "MM/DD/YYYY" so that international visitors can look for the correct date of a sighting
